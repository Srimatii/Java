# Java Basics

## Introduction
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended 
to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that 
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
recompilation. 

## Variables and Data Types
Java supports various data types. Here are the most common:
- **int**: Integer
- **float**: Floating point number
- **char**: Character
- **String**: Sequence of characters
- **boolean**: true or false

Example:
int number = 10;
float decimal = 5.75f;
char letter = 'A';
String text = "Hello";
boolean flag = true;

## Operators
Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. These include:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`


## Control Statements
Control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
- **If-else statement**
- **Switch statement**
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
